# Detecting Bots on Twitter Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the "Detecting Bots on Twitter Using Machine Learning" repository! This project focuses on utilizing Machine Learning techniques to discern between automated Twitter accounts (bots) and genuine users. By employing feature engineering and extraction, we aim to predict whether a Twitter account is a bot or a real user. Our efforts include significant feature engineering, selection, and experimentation with algorithms, culminating in a custom model with an AUC score exceeding 95%.
